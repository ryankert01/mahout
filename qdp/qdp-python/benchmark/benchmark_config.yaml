# Benchmark configuration for fair comparison
# This file demonstrates the configuration format for Apache Mahout QDP benchmarks

fairness:
  # Number of warmup iterations before timing measurements
  # Recommended: 3-5 for small workloads, 1-2 for large workloads
  warmup_iters: 3
  
  # Number of repeated measurements for statistical analysis
  # Recommended: 20-50 for medium operations, 10-20 for slow operations
  repeat_runs: 20
  
  # Whether to clear GPU cache between each measurement run
  # false: Faster but may include cache effects (recommended for most benchmarks)
  # true: Slower but more conservative measurements
  clear_cache_between_runs: false
  
  # Use CUDA events for GPU timing (more accurate than time.perf_counter)
  use_cuda_events: true

statistics:
  # Which percentiles to collect in statistical analysis
  collect_percentiles: [25, 50, 75, 90, 95, 99]
  
  # Method for outlier detection: 'iqr' or 'zscore'
  # iqr: Interquartile range method (recommended)
  # zscore: Standard deviation method
  outlier_detection: 'iqr'
  
  # Threshold for outlier detection
  # For IQR: 1.5 is standard, 3.0 is very conservative
  # For zscore: 3.0 is standard
  outlier_threshold: 1.5

visualization:
  # Directory to save benchmark plots and tables
  output_dir: './benchmark_results'
  
  # Output formats for plots
  plot_formats: ['png', 'pdf']
  
  # DPI for publication-quality images
  dpi: 300
  
  # Matplotlib style (see matplotlib.style.available for options)
  style: 'seaborn-v0_8-paper'
  
  # Which plots to generate
  plots:
    - 'bar_chart'        # Bar chart with error bars
    - 'box_plot'         # Box plot showing quartiles
    - 'violin_plot'      # Violin plot showing distributions
    - 'comparison_table' # Markdown table with statistics

# Workload configurations for different benchmark scenarios
workloads:
  # End-to-end benchmark (disk to GPU)
